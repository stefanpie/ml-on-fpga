# ml-on-fpga

This project is my attempt to implement machine learning inferencing models in FPGAs using open source tools including the nMigen, Yosys, nextpnr, and Project IceStorm and open-source hardware iCEBreaker FPGA dev board based on the Lattice iCE40UP5k FPGA. This is also very much a learning experience for me to familiarize myself with the open-source FPGA ecosystem. More details to come.
